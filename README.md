# Network Security Home Labs

This respository is primarily going to be used for labs related to network security. It will include both lab experiments as well as write-ups to explain what is going on throughout. All of these labs are done safely on a VM on my own personal device in order for me to safely simulate all types of attacks without destroying any real or active systems.
